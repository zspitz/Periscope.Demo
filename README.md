# Periscope.Demo

This is a simple (read: rather useless) demo of a custom visualizer that uses [Periscope](https://github.com/zspitz/Periscope). It targets a `Random` and presents the next `x` numbers based on the `Config`.

Note that because the `Random.Next` method is called, the state of the `Random` will change (I think).
